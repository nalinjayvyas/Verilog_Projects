# RISC-V Instruction Set Implementation

## üìå Overview
This project was developed as part of the **e-Yantra Robotics Competition 2024 (EYRC24)** conducted by IIT Bombay.  
The task involved implementing a subset of the **RISC-V ISA** (R-type and I-type instructions) in **Verilog** using Intel Quartus Prime.  
The design was functionally verified using **ModelSim**  

The goal of the project was to gain practical experience in **RTL coding, simulation, and verification**, while improving understanding of instruction execution at the hardware level.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Implemented **R-type** instructions: `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, etc.  
- Implemented **I-type** instructions: `ADDI`, `ORI`, `ANDI`, etc.  
- Modular design:
  - **ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit)  
  - **Register File**  
  - **Instruction Decode Unit**  
- Basic control logic for instruction execution  
- **Testbench** included for simulation and debugging

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Verilog HDL** for RTL design  
- **Intel Quartus Prime** (design + synthesis)  
- **ModelSim** (functional simulation + waveform analysis)  
- **TimingQuest Analyzer** (basic timing analysis)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project
### 1. Simulation in ModelSim
1. Open `riscv_core_tb.v` (testbench).  
2. Compile all Verilog files.  
3. Run the simulation:  
   ```
   vsim riscv_core_tb
   run 1000ns
   ```
4. Open `waveform` to check instruction execution results.  

### 2. Synthesis in Quartus
1. Create a new Quartus project.  
2. Add source files from the `/src` folder.  
3. Assign `riscv_core.v` as the top-level module.  
4. Run synthesis and check reports in `/output_files/`.

## ‚úÖ Results
- Verified correct execution of implemented instructions in simulation.  
- Functional waveforms confirm ALU operations and register updates.  
- Timing analysis showed successful operation at the target clock frequency.
